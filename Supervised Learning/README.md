# Birth Rate Trend Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project analyzes South Korea's birth rate trends using historical data from the World Bank and applies machine learning models to predict future birth rates. The goal is to identify key socio-economic factors influencing birth rates and provide actionable insights for policymakers.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- **Data Source:** World Bank data on South Korea's birth rates and socio-economic indicators.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Linear Regression
- **Key Metrics:** RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ§ª Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Collected data from the World Bank API.
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identified key features such as population, GDP per capita, and life expectancy.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Applied Random Forest and Linear Regression models to predict future birth rates.
   - Evaluated model performance using RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

4. **Visualization:**
   - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize historical trends and model predictions.
